# Purpose

The purpose of this software is provide a membership tracking platform for use by a company and their members. We created it to be used as a gym membership database, but the application can be applied elsewhere. It is simple in design and easy to apply to any computer, giving it great flexibility.

# Features & Benefits

-Adding/Removing accounts

-Changing membership options

-Creating new utilities/activities

-Convenient member access for viewing & limited account changes

-Changes are immediate

# Front end

In use with eclipse and additional Jar plugins like WindowBuilder /
Swing Design, Java has been an efficient language to use. A few other
external Java JARs were imported for use of making a database
connection and developing a method to hash passwords created in the
Front-end of the application.

-The PostgreSQL JDBC Driver 42.2.8 had been used to be imported in
the GUI application for setting up a database connection, creating
SQL syntax to be passed as a query though these recorded statements
into a database and record results from the database.

-Mindrotâ€™s, jBCrypt-0.4, a Java implementation of the hashing
algorithm was compiled and imported for part of the project library to
ensure every password created will be hashed and saved in the
database.

-For development tools, WindowBuilder was utilized in the Eclipse
IDE for a powerful, easy to use GUI designer to create buttons,
panels, labels, as well as fields onto the application frame for login
use once compiled.
